# FastAPI Beginner Project 🚀

This is a beginner-level FastAPI project following a clean and scalable folder structure. The goal is to help new developers organize their FastAPI applications in a modular way, so they can scale easily as the app grows.

## 🗂️ Explanation of Folders & Files

### `app/main.py`
The main entry point for your FastAPI app. It includes app initialization and router inclusion.

### `app/routers/`
This folder contains all route files. You can group routes by feature (e.g., `user.py`, `auth.py`, `post.py`).

### `app/models/`
Houses all SQLAlchemy database models. Models represent database tables.

### `app/schemas/`
Contains Pydantic models for request validation and response formatting. These are used in routes and CRUD operations.

### `app/crud/`
Includes functions that interact with the database (create, read, update, delete). Keeps business logic separate from routes.

### `app/database.py`
Handles database connection setup and session management using SQLAlchemy.

### `.env`
Used to store sensitive configuration like database URL, secret keys, etc. (Don't forget to add `.env` to your `.gitignore`!)

### `requirements.txt`
Lists all dependencies required to run your project (e.g., FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Uvicorn).
